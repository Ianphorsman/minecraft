Development Path
----------------

### Major Release Milestone

- Complete test coverage
- Complete documentation coverage
- All feature requests closed
- All bugs closed
- Thorough testing done across multiple environments


### Semantic Versioning

- http://semver.org
- Currently patch level releases are being made, nothing is stable yet.
- Once tests and documentation has been written a stable minor release will be
committed.
- Once the repository is completely stable and I am satisified with the feature
set, a major version will be released.  Any chances afterwards are backwards
compatible until the major version is incremented.
